      Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth
      English), or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies” (Ireland), is a paper-and-pencil game
      for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid.
      The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal,
      horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a
      forced draw assuming best play from both players.

      Where Did the Name Come From? The early Roman version was known as terni
      lapilli, or three pebbles at a time. In the mid-1800s, Britain used the
      name noughts and crosses, with nought referring to the O’s (or zeros) used
      in the game. The phrase tick-tack-toe wasn’t used until the late 1800s,
      and there’s some findings that report it might have been used to describe
      a completely different game. The United States officially adopted the name
      tic tac toe in the 20th century. Historians aren’t completely clear about
      the origin of the game’s name, but it could be referring to the noise of
      repetitive ticking or writing that goes along with the game’s play.
